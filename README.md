## How to be a good **Developer**?
### To be a good developer you should have these properties  

- Conceiving The **Purpose** of Software
- The **Goals** of Software Design
- **(Mis)** understanding
- Simplicity
- Complexity

## 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software

First of all, you should understand the purpose of the software. There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: **To help people** .

## 2. The Goals of Software Design

### Every *programmer* is a *designer* .

When software is hard to create or modify, developers spend most of their time focusing on making things “just work,” and less time focusing on helping users. The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters. You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.

## 3. **(Mis)** understanding

Developers who don’t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems. It can become a vicious cycle: misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.

## 4. Simplicity

- Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

- A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs.

## 5. Complexity

The source of many software failures is complexity. You start out with a simple project that can be completed in one month. Then you add complexity, and the task will take up to three months. Then you start to add features that fulfill some other purpose. Things get very complex because you expand your software purpose for no reason. The tasks will take six months.
